	abstract = {Observations have indicated that we do not see neutron stars (NS) of mass near the theoretical upper limit as predicted. Here we invoke the role of dark matter (DM) particles in star formation, and their role in lowering the mass of remnants eventually formed from these stars. Massive stars can capture DM particles more effectively than the lower mass stars, thus further softening the equation of state of the remnant neutron stars. We also look at the capture of DM particles by the NS, which could further soften the upper mass limit of NS. The admixture of DM particles would be higher at earlier epochs (high z).},

This is due to two combined effects, the capture and accumulation of self-interacting, non-annihilating dark matter by pulsars, and the increase of the dark matter density going towards the galactic centre. We show that mass decrease depends both on the density profile of dark matter, steeper profiles producing a faster and larger decrease of the pulsar mass, and on the strength of self-interaction. Once future observations will provide the pulsar mass in a dark matter rich environment, close to the galactic centre, the present result will be able to put constraints on the characteristics of our Galaxy halo dark matter profile, on the nature of dark matter, namely on its annihilating or non-annihilating nature, on its strength of self-interaction, and on the particle mass.},

GW170817 was followed by a range of EM counterparts, including a weak gamma-ray burst (GRB), kilonova (KN) emission from the radioactive decay of the merger ejecta, and X-ray/radio emission consistent with being the synchrotron afterglow of a more powerful off-axis jet. The type of compact remnant produced in the immediate merger aftermath, and its predicted EM signal, depend sensitively on the high-density NS equation of state (EOS). For a soft EOS which supports a low \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$, the merger undergoes a prompt collapse accompanied by a small quantity of shock-heated or disk wind ejecta, inconsistent with the large quantity \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ of lanthanide-free ejecta inferred from the KN. On the other hand, if \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ is sufficiently large, then the merger product is a rapidly-rotating supramassive NS (SMNS), which must spin-down before collapsing into a black hole. A fraction of the enormous rotational energy necessarily released by the SMNS during this process is transferred to the ejecta, either into the GRB jet (energy \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm GRB\}\$) or the KN ejecta (energy \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ej\}\$), also inconsistent with observations. By combining the total binary mass of GW170817 inferred from the GW signal with conservative upper limits on \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm GRB\}\$ and \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ej\}\$ from EM observations, we constrain the likelihood probability of a wide-range of previously-allowed EOS. These two constraints delineate an allowed region of the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}-R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ns\}\$ parameter space, which once marginalized over NS radius places an upper limit of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 2.17M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (90{\textbackslash}\%), which is tighter or arguably less model-dependent than other current constraints.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the number of pulsars with secure mass measurements has increased to a level that allows us to probe the underlying neutron star mass distribution in detail. We critically review radio pulsar mass measurements and present a detailed examination through which we are able to put stringent constraints on the underlying neutron star mass distribution. For the first time, we are able to analyze a sizable population of neutron star-white dwarf systems in addition to double neutron star systems with a technique that accounts for systematically different measurement errors. We find that neutron stars that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive signatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff values. Neutron stars in double neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf systems show consistent respective peaks at 1.35 Msun and 1.50 Msun which suggest significant mass accretion (Delta m{\textasciitilde}0.15 Msun) has occurred during the spin up phase. The width of the mass distribution implied by double neutron star systems is indicative of a tight initial mass function while the inferred mass range is significantly wider for neutron stars that have gone through recycling. We find a mass cutoff at 2 Msun for neutron stars with white dwarf companions which establishes a firm lower bound for the maximum neutron star mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation of state models as viable configurations for neutron star matter. The lack of truncation close to the maximum mass cutoff suggests that the 2 Msun limit is set by evolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and the existence of rare super-massive neutron stars is possible.},

radii, large, high quality datasets from X-ray satellites as well as
significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in
the measurements, placing them in the 9.9-11.2 km range and shrinking their
uncertainties due to a better understanding of the sources of systematic
errors. The combination of the massive neutron star discoveries, the tighter
radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of

that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

We perform relativistic ray-tracing of thermal emission from hot regions of the pulsar's surface. We assume two distinct hot regions based on two clear pulsed components in the phase-folded pulse-profile data; we explore a number of forms (morphologies and topologies) for each hot region, inferring their parameters in addition to the stellar mass and radius. For the family of models considered, the evidence (prior predictive probability of the data) strongly favors a model that permits both hot regions to be located in the same rotational hemisphere. Models wherein both hot regions are assumed to be simply-connected circular single-temperature spots, in particular those where the spots are assumed to be reflection-symmetric with respect to the stellar origin, are strongly disfavored. For the inferred configuration, one hot region subtends an angular extent of only a few degrees (in spherical coordinates with origin at the stellar center) and we are insensitive to other structural details; the second hot region is far more azimuthally extended in the form of a narrow arc, thus requiring a larger number of parameters to describe. The inferred mass \$M\$ and equatorial radius \$R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eq\}\$ are, respectively, \$1.34\_\{-0.16\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\$ M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \$12.71\_\{-1.19\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.14\}\$ km, whilst the compactness \$GM/R\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{eq\}c{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.156\_\{-0.010\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.008\}\$ is more tightly constrained; the credible interval bounds reported here are approximately the \$16{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$84{\textbackslash}\%\$ quantiles in marginal posterior mass.},

Our timing observations of the radio pulsar in the system span a period of about 2.5 years. This timing campaign allowed a precise measurement of its spin period (62.4 ms) and its derivative (9.6 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.7) \${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-20\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm s{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$; from these, we derive a characteristic age of \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textbackslash},\$Gyr and a surface magnetic field strength of 2.5 \${\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$ G. These numbers indicate that this pulsar was mildly recycled by accretion of matter from the progenitor of the companion star. The system has an eccentric (\$e{\textbackslash}, = {\textbackslash}, 0.17\$) 2.61 day orbit. This eccentricity allows a highly significant measurement of the rate of advance of periastron, \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}omega\} = 0.07686 {\textbackslash}pm 0.00046 {\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.

The minimum companion mass is \$0.92{\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and the maximum pulsar mass is \$1.62{\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. The large companion mass and the orbital eccentricity suggest that PSR J1411+2551 is a double neutron star system; the lightest known to date including the DNS merger GW 170817. Furthermore, the relatively low orbital eccentricity and small proper motion limits suggest that the second supernova had a relatively small associated kick; this and the low system mass suggest that it was an ultra-stripped supernova.},

	abstract = {New millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in compact binaries provide a good opportunity to search for the most massive neutron stars. Their main-sequence companion stars are often strongly irradiated by the pulsar, displacing the effective center of light from their barycenter and making mass measurements uncertain. We present a series of optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of PSR J2215+5135, a "redback" binary MSP in a 4.14 hr orbit, and measure a drastic temperature contrast between the dark/cold (T\$\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{N\}\$=5660\${\textasciicircum}\{+260\}\_\{-380\}\$ K) and bright/hot (T\$\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{D\}\$=8080\${\textasciicircum}\{+470\}\_\{-280\}\$ K) sides of the companion star. We find that the radial velocities depend systematically on the atmospheric absorption lines used to measure them. Namely, the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve of J2215 measured with magnesium triplet lines is systematically higher than that measured with hydrogen Balmer lines, by 10\%. We interpret this as a consequence of strong irradiation, whereby metallic lines dominate the dark side of the companion (which moves faster) and Balmer lines trace its bright (slower) side. Further, using a physical model of an irradiated star to fit simultaneously the two-species radial velocity curves and the three-band light curves, we find a center-of-mass velocity of K\$\_2\$=412.3\${\textbackslash}pm\$5.0 km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and an orbital inclination i=63.9\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$\${\textasciicircum}\{+2.4\}\_\{-2.7\}\$.

(2019) the implications of this measurement for the dense matter equation of state (EOS) were explored using two parameterizations of the high-density EOS: a piecewise-polytropic model, and a model based on the speed of sound in neutron stars. In this work we obtain further constraints on the EOS following this approach, but we also include information about the tidal deformability of neutron stars from the gravitational wave signal of the compact binary merger GW170817. We compare the constraints on the EOS to those set by the recent measurement of a 2.14 solar mass pulsar, included as a likelihood function approximated by a Gaussian, and find a small increase in information gain. To show the flexibility of our method, we also explore the possibility that GW170817 was a neutron star-black hole merger, which yields weaker constraints on the EOS.},

X-ray detectors. We also take into account the results of recent theoretical

critical flux. We employ Bayesian statistical frameworks to obtain neutron star
radii from the spectroscopic measurements as well as to infer the equation of

experiments in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density and the observations
of {\textasciitilde}2 Msun neutron stars, we place strong and quantitative constraints on the
properties of the equation of state between approximately 2-8 times the nuclear

	abstract = {Despite its importance to our understanding of physics at supranuclear densities, the equation of state (EoS) of matter deep within neutron stars remains poorly understood. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are among the most useful astrophysical objects in the Universe for testing fundamental physics, and place some of the most stringent constraints on this high-density EoS. Pulsar timing - the process of accounting for every rotation of a pulsar over long time periods - can precisely measure a wide variety of physical phenomena, including those that allow the measurement of the masses of the components of a pulsar binary system (Lorimer \& Kramer 2005). One of these, called relativistic Shapiro delay (Shapiro 1964), can yield precise masses for both an MSP and its companion; however, it is only easily observed in a small subset of high-precision, highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary pulsar systems. By combining data from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 12.5-year data set with recent orbital-phase-specific observations using the Green Bank Telescope, we have measured the mass of the MSP J0740+6620 to be \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{2.14{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.09\}\}\$ solar masses (68.3\% credibility interval; 95.4\% credibility interval is \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{2.14{\textasciicircum}\{+0.20\}\_\{-0.18\}\}\$ solar masses). It is highly likely to be the most massive neutron star yet observed, and serves as a strong constraint on the neutron star interior EoS.},

	abstract = {With an average density higher than the nuclear density, neutron stars (NS) provide a unique test-ground for nuclear physics, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and nuclear superfluidity. Determination of the fundamental interactions that govern matter under such extreme conditions is one of the major unsolved problems of modern physics, and -- since it is impossible to replicate these conditions on Earth -- a major scientific motivation for SKA. The most stringent observational constraints come from measurements of NS bulk properties: each model for the microscopic behaviour of matter predicts a specific density-pressure relation (its `Equation of state', EOS). This generates a unique mass-radius relation which predicts a characteristic radius for a large range of masses and a maximum mass above which NS collapse to black holes. It also uniquely predicts other bulk quantities, like maximum spin frequency and moment of inertia. The SKA, in Phase 1 and particularly in Phase 2 will, thanks to the exquisite timing precision enabled by its raw sensitivity, and surveys that dramatically increase the number of sources: 1) Provide many more precise NS mass measurements (high mass NS measurements are particularly important for ruling out EOS models); 2) Allow the measurement of the NS moment of inertia in highly relativistic binaries such as the Double Pulsar; 3) Greatly increase the number of fast-spinning NS, with the potential discovery of spin frequencies above those allowed by some EOS models; 4) Improve our knowledge of new classes of binary pulsars such as black widows and redbacks (which may be massive as a class) through sensitive broad-band radio observations; and 5) Improve our understanding of dense matter superfluidity and the state of matter in the interior through the study of rotational glitches, provided that an ad-hoc campaign is developed.},

GW170817 was followed by a range of EM counterparts, including a weak gamma-ray burst (GRB), kilonova (KN) emission from the radioactive decay of the merger ejecta, and X-ray/radio emission consistent with being the synchrotron afterglow of a more powerful off-axis jet. The type of compact remnant produced in the immediate merger aftermath, and its predicted EM signal, depend sensitively on the high-density NS equation of state (EOS). For a soft EOS which supports a low \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$, the merger undergoes a prompt collapse accompanied by a small quantity of shock-heated or disk wind ejecta, inconsistent with the large quantity \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ of lanthanide-free ejecta inferred from the KN. On the other hand, if \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}\$ is sufficiently large, then the merger product is a rapidly-rotating supramassive NS (SMNS), which must spin-down before collapsing into a black hole. A fraction of the enormous rotational energy necessarily released by the SMNS during this process is transferred to the ejecta, either into the GRB jet (energy \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm GRB\}\$) or the KN ejecta (energy \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ej\}\$), also inconsistent with observations. By combining the total binary mass of GW170817 inferred from the GW signal with conservative upper limits on \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm GRB\}\$ and \$E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ej\}\$ from EM observations, we constrain the likelihood probability of a wide-range of previously-allowed EOS. These two constraints delineate an allowed region of the \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\}-R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ns\}\$ parameter space, which once marginalized over NS radius places an upper limit of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm max\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 2.17M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ (90{\textbackslash}\%), which is tighter or arguably less model-dependent than other current constraints.},

In particular, we show that core-collapse supernovae are launched within 100-200 milliseconds of the initial stellar collapse, implying that the explosions are driven by instabilities with a rapid (10-20 ms) growth time. Alternatively, if future observations fill in the gap, this will be an indication that these instabilities develop over a longer ({\textgreater}200 milliseconds) timescale.},

Combining this measurement with the existence of two-solar-mass stars, we generate a generic family of
neutron-star-matter equations of state (EOSs) that interpolate between state-of-the-art theoretical results at low and high baryon density. Comparing the results to ones obtained without the tidal-deformability constraint, we witness a dramatic reduction in the family of allowed EOSs. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the maximal radius of a 1.4-solar-mass neutron star is 13.6 km, and that the smallest allowed tidal deformability of a similar-mass star is Λ (1.4

	abstract = {The first detection of gravitational waves from a neutron star-neutron star merger, GW170817, has opened up a new avenue for constraining the ultradense-matter equation of state (EOS). The deviation of the observed waveform from a point-particle waveform is a sensitive probe of the EOS controlling the merging neutron stars' structure. In this topical review, I discuss the various constraints that have been made on the EOS in the year following the discovery of GW170817. In particular, I review the surprising relationship that has emerged between the effective tidal deformability of the binary system and the neutron star radius. I also report new results that make use of this relationship, finding that the radius inferred from GW170817 lies between 9.8 and 13.2 km at 90\% confidence, with distinct likelihood peaks at 10.8 and 12.3 km. I compare these radii, as well as those inferred in the literature, to X-ray measurements of the neutron star radius. I also summarize the various maximum mass constraints, which point towards a maximum mass {\textless} 2.3 M\_sun, depending on the fate of the remnant, and which can be used to additionally constrain the high-density EOS. I review the constraints on the EOS that have been performed directly, through Bayesian inference schemes. Finally, I comment on the importance of disentangling thermal effects in future EOS constraints from neutron star mergers.},

	abstract = {We present timing models for 20 millisecond pulsars in the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. The precision of the parameter measurements in these models has been improved over earlier results by using longer data sets and modelling the non-stationary noise. We describe a new noise
modelling procedure and demonstrate its effectiveness using simulated data. Our methodology includes the addition of annual dispersion measure (DM) variations to the timing models of some pulsars. We present the first significant parallax measurements for PSRs J1024-0719, J1045-4509, J1600-3053, J1603-7202, and J1730-2304, as well as the first significant measurements of some post-Keplerian orbital parameters in six binary pulsars, caused by kinematic effects. Improved Shapiro delay
measurements have resulted in much improved pulsar mass measurements, particularly for PSRs J0437-4715 and J1909-3744 with Mp = 1.44 ± 0.07 and 1.47 ± 0.03 M⊙,
respectively. The improved orbital period-derivative measurement for PSR J0437-4715 results in a derived distance measurement at the 0.16 per cent level of precision, D = 156.79 ± 0.25 pc, one of the most
fractionally precise distance measurements of any star to date.},

densities, the equation of state (EoS) of matter deep within neutron
stars remains poorly understood. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are among
the most useful astrophysical objects in the Universe for testing
fundamental physics, and place some of the most stringent constraints on
this high-density EoS. Pulsar timing—the process of accounting for
every rotation of a pulsar over long time periods—can precisely
measure a wide variety of physical phenomena, including those that allow
the measurement of the masses of the components of a pulsar binary
system1. One of these, called relativistic Shapiro
delay2, can yield precise masses for both an MSP and its
companion; however, it is only easily observed in a small subset of
high-precision, highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary pulsar systems.
By combining data from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for
Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 12.5-yr data set with recent
orbital-phase-specific observations using the Green Bank Telescope, we
have measured the mass of the MSP J0740+6620 to be 2
.14-0.09 +0 .10 ? M⊙ (68.3\%
credibility interval; the 95.4\% credibility interval is 2
.14-0.18 +0 .20 ? M⊙). It is highly
likely to be the most massive neutron star yet observed, and serves as a
strong constraint on the neutron star interior EoS.},

Data Release 1.0 extends up to mid-2014 and baselines range from 7-18
yr. It forms the basis for the stochastic gravitational-wave background,
anisotropic background, and continuous-wave limits recently presented by
the EPTA elsewhere. The Bayesian timing analysis performed with
TEMPONEST yields the detection of several new parameters: seven
parallaxes, nine proper motions and, in the case of six binary pulsars,
an apparent change of the semimajor axis. We find the NE2001 Galactic
electron density model to be a better match to our parallax distances
(after correction from the Lutz-Kelker bias) than the M2 and M3 models
by Schnitzeler. However, we measure an average uncertainty of 80 per
cent (fractional) for NE2001, three times larger than what is typically
assumed in the literature. We revisit the transverse velocity
distribution for a set of 19 isolated and 57 binary MSPs and find no
statistical difference between these two populations. We detect Shapiro
delay in the timing residuals of PSRs J1600-3053 and J1918-0642,

determine neutron star masses: radio pulsations reveal the motion of the
neutron star, while that of the companion can be characterised through
studies in the optical range. PSR J1012+5307 is a millisecond pulsar in
a 14.5-h orbit with a helium-core white dwarf companion. In this work we
present the analysis of an optical spectroscopic campaign, where the
companion star absorption features reveal one of the lightest known
white dwarfs. We determine a white dwarf radial velocity semi-amplitude
of K2 = 218.9 ± 2.2 km s-1, which
combined with that of the pulsar derived from the precise radio timing,
yields a mass ratio of q = 10.44 ± 0.11. We also attempt to infer
the white dwarf mass from observational constraints using new binary
evolution models for extremely low-mass white dwarfs, but find that they
cannot reproduce all observed parameters simultaneously. In particular,
we cannot reconcile the radius predicted from binary evolution with the
measurement from the photometric analysis (RWD =
0.047-0.002+0.003 R⊙). Our limited
understanding of extremely low-mass white dwarf evolution, which results
from binary interaction, therefore comes as the main factor limiting the
precision with which we can measure the mass of the white dwarf in this
system. Our conservative white dwarf mass estimate of MWD =
0.165 ± 0.015 M⊙, along with the mass ratio
enables us to infer a pulsar mass of MNS = 1.72 ± 0.16
M⊙. This value is clearly above the canonical ∼1.4
M⊙, therefore adding PSR J1012+5307 to the growing list
of massive millisecond pulsars.},

Here, we present a Bayesian statistical method of inferring the pressures at ﬁve ﬁxed densities, from a sample of mock neutron star masses and radii. We show that while ﬁve polytropic segments are needed for maximum ﬂexibility in the absence of any prior knowledge of the EoS, regularizers are also necessary to ensure that simple underlying EoS are not over-parameterized. For ideal data with small measurement uncertainties, we show that the pressure at roughly twice the nuclear saturation density, rsat, can be inferred to within 0.3 dex for many realizations of potential sources of uncertainties. The pressures of more complicated EoS with signiﬁcant phase transitions can also be inferred to within ∼30\%. We also ﬁnd that marginalizing the multi-dimensional parameter space of pressure to infer a mass–radius relation can lead to biases of nearly 1 km in radius, toward larger radii. Using the full, ﬁve-dimensional posterior likelihoods avoids this bias.},

	abstract = {The possibility that neutron stars may contain substantial hyperon populations has important implications for neutron-star cooling and, through bulk viscosity, the viability of the r-modes of accreting neutron stars as sources of persistent gravitational waves. In conjunction with laboratory measurements of hypernuclei, astronomical observations were used by Glendenning and Moszkowski [Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 2414 (1991)] to constrain the properties of hyperonic equations of state within the framework of relativistic mean-field theory. We revisit the problem, incorporating recent measurements of high neutron-star masses and a gravitational redshift. We find that only the stiffest of the relativistic hyperonic equations of state commonly used in the literature is compatible with the redshift. However, it is possible to construct stiffer equations of state within the same framework which produce the observed redshift while satisfying the experimental constraints on hypernuclei, and we do this. The stiffness parameter that most affects the redshift is not the incompressibility but rather the hyperon coupling. Nonrelativistic potential-based equations of state with hyperons are not constrained by the redshift, primarily due to a smaller stellar radius.},

	abstract = {Properties of dense nucleon matter and the structure of neutron stars are studied using variational chain summation methods and the new Argonne v18 two-nucleon interaction, which provides an excellent fit to all of the nucleon-nucleon scattering data in the Nijmegen database. The neutron star gravitational mass limit obtained with this interaction is 1.67M⊙. Boost corrections to the two-nucleon interaction, which give the leading relativistic effect of order (v/c)2, as well as three-nucleon interactions, are also included in the nuclear Hamiltonian. Their successive addition increases the mass limit to 1.80 and 2.20 M⊙. Hamiltonians including a three-nucleon interaction predict a transition in neutron star matter to a phase with neutral pion condensation at a baryon number density of ∼0.2fm−3. Neutron stars predicted by these Hamiltonians have a layer with a thickness on the order of tens of meters, over which the density changes rapidly from that of the normal to the condensed phase. The material in this thin layer is a mixture of the two phases. We also investigate the possibility of dense nucleon matter having an admixture of quark matter, described using the bag model equation of state. Neutron stars of 1.4M⊙ do not appear to have quark matter admixtures in their cores. However, the heaviest stars are predicted to have cores consisting of a quark and nucleon matter mixture. These admixtures reduce the maximum mass of neutron stars from 2.20 to 2.02 (1.91) M⊙ for bag constant B=200(122)MeV/fm3. Stars with pure quark matter in their cores are found to be unstable. We also consider the possibility that matter is maximally incompressible above an assumed density, and show that realistic models of nuclear forces limit the maximum mass of neutron stars to be below 2.5M⊙. The effects of the phase transitions on the composition of neutron star matter and its adiabatic index Γ are discussed.},

	abstract = {The structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.},

and binary evolution provides an opportunity to incorporate major
improvements to the predictions from population synthesis models. We
compute the Galactic merger rates for NS-NS, BH-NS, and BH-BH mergers
with the StarTrack code. The most important revisions include updated
wind mass-loss rates (allowing for stellar-mass black holes up to 80 M
⊙), a realistic treatment of the common envelope phase
(a process that can affect merger rates by 2-3 orders of magnitude), and
a qualitatively new neutron star/black hole mass distribution
(consistent with the observed "mass gap"). Our findings include the
following. (1) The binding energy of the envelope plays a pivotal role
in determining whether a binary merges within a Hubble time. (2) Our
description of natal kicks from supernovae plays an important role,
especially for the formation of BH-BH systems. (3) The masses of BH-BH
systems can be substantially increased in the case of low metallicities
or weak winds. (4) Certain combinations of parameters underpredict the
Galactic NS-NS merger rate and can be ruled out. (5) Models
incorporating delayed supernovae do not agree with the observed NS/BH
"mass gap," in accordance with our previous work. This is the first in a
series of three papers. The second paper will study the merger rates of
double compact objects as a function of redshift, star formation rate,
and metallicity. In the third paper, we will present the detection rates
for gravitational-wave observatories, using up-to-date signal waveforms
and sensitivity curves.},
